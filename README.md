# Aether-Kernel
A minimalist Unix-like operating system kernel built from scratch in C and Assembly. It features: 
   - Multiboot-compliant bootloader integration with GRUB
   - VGA text mode output with custom drivers
   - Interrupt handling with programmable timer and keyboard drivers
   - Preemptive multitasking via a round-robin scheduler
   - Simple paging-based memory management
   - In-memory simulated file system
   - Basic shell supporting command execution and built-in commands
   - Runs on QEMU and Bochs virtual machines for easy development and testing

Designed as a learning project to explore and implement core OS concepts including kernel architecture, process scheduling, memory management, and device drivers.
